Quick reminder for everyone: Boise Code Camp is this Saturday!

There are 73 talks, starting at 8:00 am, and going til about 6:00 pm.

So far we have 1500 people signed up, about 300 of which for the kid track.  (for the hard-core introverts out there, yes that is a lot of people, but spread out over an entire building...so it really isn't that bad)

If you have not, please sign up (but we won't turn you away if you don't -- BSU likes to have final numbers, and it helps out sponsors as well)

I hope to see you all there.
