BSDG, or Boise Software Developerâ€™s Group, is a technology agnostic development group. We try to cover a wide range of technology topics on various platforms. This includes .net, Java, Ruby, Python, ObjectiveC, JavaScript, and others. We also love to talk about more high level topics like design patterns, best practices, architecture and the like.
